# update-letsencrypt - script for updating certifiactes

This really is a cheap shot - invoke update of certificates previously obtained
from "Let's Encrypt!".

It adds a little bit of logging, so you know where to look if it does fail.

I run it every month via cron in order to renew my certificates.
